## About the project

There would be 2 parts of the project: CNN MODEL (using mostly standard library) - GUI (using tkiner)

If you're not using Nix it is recommended to:
- Develop in python virtual environment
- (Optional) Load dependencies with pip by:

```sh
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Run App 
```sh
python3 app.py
```
